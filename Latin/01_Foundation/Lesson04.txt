	## First Declension Nouns — Dative Singular and Plural

	In Latin, the **dative case** is used to show the **indirect object** of a
	sentence — the person or thing **to** or **for** whom something is given,
	shown, or done.

	---

	## First Declension Dative Endings

	| Case     | Singular | Plural  |
	|----------|----------|---------|
	| Dative   | -ae      | -īs      |

	For first declension nouns, the dative singular ends in **-ae**, and the
	dative plural ends in **-īs**.

	Using the dative case allows Latin to clearly express **to whom** or **for
	whom** an action is done, an important part of everyday communication.

	## Conjunctions: **sed** and **-que**

	### 1. **sed** — "but"

	- **sed** is a coordinating conjunction used to express contrast or
	opposition between two ideas.
	- It is similar to the English word **"but."**
	- It often introduces a sentence or clause that contrasts with what was
	said before.

	---

	### 2. **-que** — "and" (enclitic conjunction)

	- **-que** is an enclitic conjunction, meaning it is attached to the end of
	the **second** word in the phrase.
	- It means **"and,"** linking two words or phrases closely.
	- Unlike **et**, it is not a separate word but a suffix.

	## Summary

	| Conjunction | Meaning | Position in sentence                 | Example                      |
	|-------------|---------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
	| **sed**    | but     | Separate word, before contrasting clause | _Puella legit, **sed** puer laborat._ |
	| **-que**   | and     | Attached to the end of second word | _Puella puer**que** ambulant._ |

	---

	Use **sed** to show contrast, and use **-que** to connect closely linked words or ideas smoothly.
