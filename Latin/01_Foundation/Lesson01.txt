	## First Declension Nouns (Nominative and Accusative)

	In Latin, nouns are **declined**, meaning they change their endings
	depending on their **case** (grammatical role) and **number** (singular or
	plural). The **First Declension** is typically associated with **feminine
	nouns**, many of which end in **-a** in the nominative singular.

	---

	## First Declension Endings

	| Case         | Singular  | Plural   |
	|--------------|-----------|----------|
	| Nominative   | -a        | -ae      |
	| Accusative   | -am       | -ās      |

	---

	## Masculine First Declension Nouns

	While most **first declension nouns** are **feminine**, a small group are
	**masculine** in gender but **follow the same declension pattern**. These
	typically describe **professions, roles**, or **people** and often come
	from **Greek**.

	| Latin      | Meaning       | Origin       |
	|------------|---------------|--------------|
	| agricola   | farmer        | Latin        |
	| poēta      | poet          | Greek origin |
	| nauta      | sailor        | Greek origin |
	| incola     | inhabitant    | Latin        |
	| pīrāta     | pirate        | Greek origin |

	## Latin Coordinating Conjunctions

	In this lesson, we introduce six common Latin coordinating conjunctions.
	These words link nouns, verbs, or whole clauses, and are essential for
	forming longer, more expressive sentences.

	| Latin           | Meaning               | Usage Example                      | English Translation              |
	|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
	| **et**          | and                    | *puella et fēmina*                 | the girl and the woman           |
	| **aut**         | or                     | *aqua aut vinum*                   | water or wine                    |
	| **et...et**     | both...and             | *et rosa et herba*                 | both the rose and the grass      |
	| **aut...aut**   | either...or            | *aut discipula aut magistra*       | either the student or the teacher|
	| **nec**         | and not / nor          | *nec poēta cantat*                 | the poet does not sing either    |
	| **nec...nec**   | neither...nor          | *nec puella nec nauta*             | neither the girl nor the sailor  |

	### Notes:

	- **et** is the most common conjunction and connects elements **positively**.
	- **aut** shows a choice between **alternatives**.
	- **et...et** emphasizes that **both elements** are included.
	- **aut...aut** emphasizes that **only one** of the alternatives is true.
	- **nec** and **nec** are used to **negate and connect** words or clauses.
	- **nec** = and not / nor
