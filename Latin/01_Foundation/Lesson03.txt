	## Lesson 3: Present Tense Active (-āre Verbs, Plural)

	In Latin, verbs agree in number with their subjects. You’ve already
	learned singular verb forms (e.g. *portat* = “she/he carries”). Now we
	learn the **plural forms** used when the subject is plural (e.g. *puellae
	portant* = “the girls carry”).
