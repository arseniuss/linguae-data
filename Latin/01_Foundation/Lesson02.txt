	## Lesson 2: Present Tense Active (-āre Verbs, Singular)

	In Latin, the **present tense** expresses actions that are happening
	**now**, actions that happen **habitually**, or **general truths**. First
	conjugation verbs have infinitives ending in **-āre**, and they follow a
	regular pattern when conjugated. The **present active singular forms** are
	created by removing **-āre** from the infinitive and adding personal endings.

	---

	### Present Tense Endings (Singular – First Conjugation)

	| Person        | Ending | Example (amāre – "to love") | Translation        |
	|---------------|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
	| 1st person    | -ō     | amō                         | I love             |
	| 2nd person    | -ās    | amās                        | You love (sing.)   |
	| 3rd person    | -at    | amat                        | He/She/It loves    |

	> **Note:** The stem is formed by dropping **-re** from the infinitive
	(e.g. *amāre* → *amā-*), and then the endings are added.
