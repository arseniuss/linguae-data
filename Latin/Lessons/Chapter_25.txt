name "Chapter 25: Conditional Sentences"

# Study Latin conditional clauses (if-then statements) in various types:
#
#    Simple (indicative mood).
#    Future more vivid (future indicative).
#    Contrary-to-fact (subjunctive).

# Si (if) – Used to introduce conditional sentences (e.g., "Si venīs, ego te
# audiam" – If you come, I will listen to you).
# Nisi (unless) – Used in conditional sentences to introduce a negated
# condition (e.g., "Nisi venīs, ego te non audiam" – Unless you come, I will
# not listen to you).
# Ut (so that) – Can also be used to introduce a result in conditional
# sentences (in purpose clauses).
