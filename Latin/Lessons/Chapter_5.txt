	## 1. What is the Ablative Case?

	The ablative case is used to show various relationships such as means,
	separation, or accompaniment. It answers questions like "By what means?"
	"With whom?" and "From where?"

	Example: “He fights with a sword” or "He comes from the house."

	The ablative case often translates into English as "by," "with," or "from."

	## 2. Ablative Endings for the First and Second Declensions

    Here are the ablative singular endings for the first and second declensions:

	 - First Declension: _-ā_ (e.g., _puellā_ – "by/with/from the girl")
	 - Second Declension: _-ō_ (e.g., _amīcō_ – "by/with/from the friend")

	## 3. Examples of the Ablative Case in Sentences

	Here are some examples of how the ablative case is used in sentences:

	 - *Gladiō pugnat* – He/she fights with a sword.
	 - *E villā venit* – He/she comes from the house.
	 - *Cum amīcō ambulat* – He/she walks with a friend.

	## 4. Using Prepositions with the Ablative

	Some Latin prepositions always take the ablative case. For example:

	 - _Cum_ (with) – _Cum amīcō_ (With a friend)
	 - _E_ or _Ex_ (from, out of) – _E villā_ (From the house)

    ## 5. Summary

    In this chapter, you will learn to use the ablative case to show how an
	action is done, who it’s done with, and from where it originates. This case
	is very useful in describing the circumstances of actions.
