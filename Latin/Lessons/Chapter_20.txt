name "Chapter 20: Expressions of Place (Locative Case)"

# Teach the locative case for specific locations and review other expressions
# of place (e.g., Rōmae, domī).

#
# Conjunctions of Place and Direction:
#
#    ubi (where)
#    quo (to where)
#    unde (from where)
#    These fit perfectly with locative expressions.
